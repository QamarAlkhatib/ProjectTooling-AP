# Task 1-2

## Risks

1. we Faced a problem with the design, the company wanted us to choose specific colors and styles for the ticked card.

2. misunderstanding some topics with the database part.

3. The code's quality. We were a bunch of students working on the same problem. We were all writing code, styles, and putting them in random places without adding any comments, and as a result, our code quality wasn't good enough.

4. Due to our regular daily duties, we were having difficulty keeping track of time. We were concerned about not being able to complete the job on time, so we had to work on it for 24 hours. To solve it, we had to splice the tasks together.

5. Company design requirments, we had to change many things with the styling.

 - Agile technique:

 * Testing is an integrated component of the project execution phase in Agile project management, which implies the overall quality of the final product is higher. The client remains active in the development process and has the ability to request changes based on market conditions. Because Agile is an incremental method, self-organizing teams continuously learn over time and improve.

 * Improved control
Because of its transparency, feedback integration, and quality-control capabilities, Agile allows project managers to have more influence over the project. Throughout the project's implementation phase, quality is assured, and all stakeholders are kept informed with daily progress reports using advanced reporting tools and procedures.

- Testing technique
we will be using blax box, and white box testing
