## **PyCharm vs Visual Studio Code**

The Most Intelligent IDE is **PyCharm**. Python, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, CSS, major template languages, and more are all supported by PyCharm's smart code editor. Take advantage of code completion, error detection, and on-the-fly code updates that are language-aware!.
**Microsoft's Visual Studio Code** allows you to create and debug modern online and cloud apps. Create and debug cutting-edge online and cloud apps. Code is accessible for free on your preferred platform, including Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.

## **Performance**

When compared to **PyCharm**, **Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is substantially faster**. When compared to **PyCharm, it is extremely light**. Visual Studio Code is the clear winner when it comes to a **modular approach to wiring code.** **Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE) offers a large number of extensions, add-ons, and other libraries.** **PyCharm is said to have a very long lead time.**


## **Virtual environment**

In the development of libraries and experiments, the virtual environment is critical. Several Python interpreters are supported by Visual Studio Code. You can manually add virtual environments and designate their interpreters as the default in PyCharm. The biggest issue with these settings is their slowness. Both IDEs have a certain level of delay.

## **Extensions**

Most IDEs allow you to go beyond "compile and execute" in terms of functionality. Both IDEs' marketplaces enable a variety of extensions that provide new features and services. **The PyCharm and Visual Studio communities each have a strong following**. Because **PyCharm is designed only for Python programmers**, you will need to download and install alternative IDEs for other programming languages. Here, **Visual Studio Code is more modular; all it needs to know is what type of project you're working on right now. It has the ability to enable the plugins required for that particular project.**

# **Operating System**

## Linux vs Windows

1. Open Source:

    Unlike the commercial Windows operating system, **Linux is an open source operating system that may be downloaded for free**. Hundreds of Linux distributions are available, with around 500 under active development. and the most popular one is Ubuntu

2. Faster Software Updates:

    In Linux, software updates are delivered more quickly. Users receive updates instantly if bugs are discovered; they do not have to wait long. Free development libraries and tools are available.

3. Performance:

    Linux is a more powerful and adaptable operating system than Windows. Linux is lightweight, making it speedier than Windows. When you first start working with a Linux distribution, you will notice a big increase in speed.

# Version-control platform

- ## **GitHub vs GitLab**

## **Authentication Levels**

You can set and edit people's permissions in **GitLab** based on their roles. You can choose whether someone has read or write access to a repository in **GitHub**.

You can give someone access to the issue tracker (for example) without giving them access to the source code with GitLab. Larger teams and businesses with role-based contributors would benefit greatly from this.

## **Issue Tracking**
GitLab and GitHub both have a simple issue tracker that allows you to update the status and assignee for several issues at once.

## **The Community**
**GitHub** made a name for itself in the development community. And the incredibly active GitHub community of millions of developers is mostly responsible for its popularity. You can talk about issues and possibly pick up a few unofficial skills. **GitLab**, on the other side, did some fantastic things like host community events and connect open source contributors.
