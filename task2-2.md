# task2-2

in this project, i will use these:

## For IDE

 Visual Studio Code: since I will be developing a web application using JS, HTML, and CSS, also I can easily export my code into GitHub, download the extensions that I need. lastly, I'm used to using it.

## For Operating system

 I will be using Linux distribution because it's faster than windows OS, also The Linux terminal is better than the command line on Windows. Almost all programming languages are supported by Linux. and it's open-source, and almost most of the tools are free and easy to access with Linux.


## For The Version-control platform:
 I will be using GitHub because it's free and easy to use, also, it is easy to contribute to a project with a team because I will work with a team too. 
 lastly, it's great for the documentation part of the assignment
