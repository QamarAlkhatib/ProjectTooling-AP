# Task2-1
# IDE

## **PyCharm vs Visual Studio Code**

The Most Intelligent IDE is **PyCharm**. Python, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, CSS, major template languages, and more are all supported by PyCharm's smart code editor. Take advantage of code completion, error detection, and on-the-fly code updates that are language-aware!.
**Microsoft's Visual Studio Code** allows you to create and debug modern online and cloud apps. Create and debug cutting-edge online and cloud apps. Code is accessible for free on your preferred platform, including Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.

## **Performance**

When compared to **PyCharm**, **Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is substantially faster**. When compared to **PyCharm, it is extremely light**. Visual Studio Code is the clear winner when it comes to a **modular approach to wiring code.** **Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE) offers a large number of extensions, add-ons, and other libraries.** **PyCharm is said to have a very long lead time.**


## **Virtual environment**

In the development of libraries and experiments, the virtual environment is critical. Several Python interpreters are supported by Visual Studio Code. You can manually add virtual environments and designate their interpreters as the default in PyCharm. The biggest issue with these settings is their slowness. Both IDEs have a certain level of delay.

## **Extensions**

Most IDEs allow you to go beyond "compile and execute" in terms of functionality. Both IDEs' marketplaces enable a variety of extensions that provide new features and services. **The PyCharm and Visual Studio communities each have a strong following**. Because **PyCharm is designed only for Python programmers**, you will need to download and install alternative IDEs for other programming languages. Here, **Visual Studio Code is more modular; all it needs to know is what type of project you're working on right now. It has the ability to enable the plugins required for that particular project.**

# **Operating System**

## Linux vs Windows

1. Open Source:

    Unlike the commercial Windows operating system, **Linux is an open source operating system that may be downloaded for free**. Hundreds of Linux distributions are available, with around 500 under active development. and the most popular one is Ubuntu

2. Faster Software Updates:

    In Linux, software updates are delivered more quickly. Users receive updates instantly if bugs are discovered; they do not have to wait long. Free development libraries and tools are available.

3. Performance:

    Linux is a more powerful and adaptable operating system than Windows. Linux is lightweight, making it speedier than Windows. When you first start working with a Linux distribution, you will notice a big increase in speed.

# Version-control platform

- ## **GitHub vs GitLab**

## **Authentication Levels**

You can set and edit people's permissions in **GitLab** based on their roles. You can choose whether someone has read or write access to a repository in **GitHub**.

You can give someone access to the issue tracker (for example) without giving them access to the source code with GitLab. Larger teams and businesses with role-based contributors would benefit greatly from this.

## **Issue Tracking**
GitLab and GitHub both have a simple issue tracker that allows you to update the status and assignee for several issues at once.

## **The Community**
**GitHub** made a name for itself in the development community. And the incredibly active GitHub community of millions of developers is mostly responsible for its popularity. You can talk about issues and possibly pick up a few unofficial skills. **GitLab**, on the other side, did some fantastic things like host community events and connect open source contributors.



# task2-2

in this project, i will use these:

## For IDE

 Visual Studio Code: since I will be developing a web application using JS, HTML, and CSS, also I can easily export my code into GitHub, download the extensions that I need. lastly, I'm used to using it. **And I won't use the PyCharm** because It takes up more space than other text editors, which reduces code functionality. also, it's complicated to use it with virtual machine platforms and some version required cost.

## For Operating system

 I will be using Linux distribution because it's faster than windows OS, also The Linux terminal is better than the command line on Windows. Almost all programming languages are supported by Linux. and it's open-source, and almost most of the tools are free and easy to access with Linux. **And I won't use the windows OS** because its closed source, The tools that i need or might need will be hard to find it on windows os, also it is too slow for developing part and it might crash at any time.

## For The Version-control platform:

 I will be using GitHub because it's free and easy to use, also, it is easy to contribute to a project with a team because I will work with a team too. 
 lastly, it's great for the documentation part of the assignment **And I won't use the GitLab** because it's not free, it needs a free trial for 30 days to use it.

------------------------

# Task2-3:

accodring to my problem domain, i used VS code because its support HTML,CSS,JS at once and its full of extention that i nedded such as live server and its not complicated to link it with virtual machine platform. and i used linux OS because its fast than windows and its open source so i can easily download the tools that i need to use.
i used github because its support SSH keys, also its free and i can easily connect with my team into organization in github and create branches and mange our codes.
